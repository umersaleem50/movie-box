# Movie Box
MovieBox is a web app for getting information about any movie and tv show. This is build in React js along with Sass.
I build the whole front-end of this website from scatch.

## Design and UX

I use this web design from figma, but I have done a-lot of changes to as it was just desktop only design.

## Coding
I write the code as clean and reusable as I can. I used Sass instead of css for better class stucture and designed a custom architecture for better stucture of the code.
